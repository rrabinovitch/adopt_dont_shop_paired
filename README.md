# Adopt Don't Shop Paired Project
Turing School of Software & Design, Back End Module 2, Weeks 2-3 Pair Project

## Background and Description

"Adopt Don't Shop Paired" is a fictitious pet adoption platform where visitors can favorite pets and apply to adopt their newest furry friend. This project was completed in a pair by [Ruthie Rabinovitch](https://github.com/rrabinovitch) and [Garrett Gerdsen](https://github.com/ggerdsen)

This project built off of Garrett's solo project repo from week 1 of Module 2, Adopt Don't Shop.

## Overview
Our project ERD can be seen (here)[https://github.com/rrabinovitch/adopt_dont_shop_paired/blob/readme_update/erd.pdf] for a visual representation of the relationships between our database resources.

This project utilizes our recent learnings about one-to-many (`shelters`<>`pets`, `shelters`<>`shelter reviews`) and many-to-many relationships (`pets`<>`adoption applications`). As the ERD below shows, each shelter can have many pets and reviews - all of which have CRUD functionality.

Additionally, adoption applications can be submitted for many pets, and each pet can have multiple applications submitted for it. Each application can be approved for any number of pets (ie, if an application is for 3 pets, it can be approved for 0, 1, 2, or 3 pets), and each approved `pet`<>`adoption application` relationship can be revoked as well.

In order to apply to adopt pets, they must first be favorited, a feature which uses our familiarity with cart and order functionality. Implementation of this favoriting feature utilized POROs and sessions in order to store an array of the ids of pets that have been favorited and track the number of favorited pets.

The deployed version of our application can be found (here)[https://lit-depths-46900.herokuapp.com/].

The learning goals, requirements, and user stories that guided our completion of this project (as well as the solo version of the project) can be found below.


## Learning Goals

### Rails
* Describe use cases for a model that inherits from ApplicationRecord vs. a PORO
* Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in views and controllers
* Make use of flash messages
* Use Inheritance from ApplicationController or a student created controller to store methods that will be used in multiple controllers
* Use POROs to logically organize code for objects not stored in the database

### ActiveRecord
* Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to:
* create queries that calculate, select, filter, and order data from a single table

### Databases
* Describe Database Relationships, including the following terms:
* Many to Many
* Join Table

### Testing and Debugging
* Write feature tests utilizing
* Sad Path Testing
* Write model tests with RSpec including validations, and class and instance methods

### Web Applications
* Explain how Cookies/Sessions are used to create and maintain application state
* Describe and implement ReSTful routing
* Identify use cases for, and implement non-ReSTful routes
* Identify the different components of URLs(protocol, domain, path, query params)
## Requirements

- must use Rails 5.1.x
- must use PostgreSQL
- all controller and model code must be tested via feature tests and model tests, respectively
- must use good GitHub branching, team code reviews via GitHub comments, and use of a project planning tool
- must include a README to describe their project

## Permitted

- use FactoryBot to speed up your test development
- use "rails generators" to speed up your app development

## Not Permitted

- do not use JavaScript for pagination or sorting controls

## Permission

- if there is a specific gem you'd like to use in the project, please get permission from your instructors first
